# DSPIN
Code and examples of the D-SPIN framework 

## General workflow of D-SPIN

### Identifying gene or gene programs to use 

### Computing cross-correlation and mean of each perturbation condition

### Inferring the network with paraellized optimization procedure

### Computing each perturbation response vectors under the network
