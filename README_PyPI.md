# D-SPIN: Constructing regulatory network models from scRNA-seq perturbation profiling  

D-SPIN is a computational framework for constructing regulatory network models of genes or gene programs from single-cell RNA-seq profiling of perturbation conditions. D-SPIN integrates information from multiple perturbation conditions for network inference with improved efficienty and accuracy. The regulatory network can be defined on single genes or gene programs (groups of coexpressed genes). The package includes implementation of gene program discovery, network inference, and network analysis.
